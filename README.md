# Excel.Influenza-Season
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff. In this project I will give advice on when to send staff, and how many, to each state in the upcoming season. 
# Project Overview
- **Motivation**: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.
- **Objective**: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
- **Scope**: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
# Requirements
- Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
- Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
- Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
# Data
The following datasets have been used for this analysis:
- [Influenza deaths by geography](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da_program/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx)
- [Population data by geography, time, age, and gender](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv)
# Tools
For this project I used Excel and Tableau
# Sources
The dataset containing information about influenza deaths comes from [CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html), which is a governmental source.
The population dataset is from the US Census Bureau, which is also government data.
